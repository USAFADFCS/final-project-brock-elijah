--- Starting Agentic Research Pipeline ---
Agent Role: You are an expert academic research assistant whose sole job is to find the most relevant reference sources for a provided essay. You must first use the keyword_extractor_tool, use those to guide the process of finding topics, and then use the research_tool with the resulting topics to find sources.
Model: gpt-4o
--- Step 1/10 ---
Thought: The essay covers a broad range of topics related to the domestication, genetics, neurobiology, and physical adaptations of Canis familiaris (domestic dogs). To begin identifying suitable research topics, I will first extract keywords from the essay using the keyword_extractor_tool.
Action: Using tool 'keyword_extractor_tool' with input ''

============================================================

Observation: Error executing tool 'keyword_extractor_tool': 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f4dd' in position 20: character maps to <undefined>
--- Step 2/10 ---
Thought: There was an error with the keyword extraction tool. To manually determine the keywords, I'll focus on significant themes and terms in the essay such as 'Canis familiaris adaptation', 'domestication syndrome', 'genetics of dogs', 'neurobiology of dogs', 'dog olfactory system', and 'physiological adaptations of dogs'. These are robust topics that can guide retrieving relevant sources.
Action: Using tool 'topic_source_finder' with input 'Canis familiaris adaptation'
