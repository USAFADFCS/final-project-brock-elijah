Purpose: Create a minimalist agentic framework that uses the OpenAI API, the ReACT framework, and 
a custom toolset to solve problems.

Design:

# this class is never actually implemented, it just describes the signatures to
# expect for every entry in the tool_list argument of the Agent constructor.
class Tool:
    description : str # a text description of the tool, what it does, and what arguments it needs
    use(args : "str") # returns False if there was an issue, a string output otherwise

# an example base system prompt string that might be passed to the Agent constructor:
"""
You are helpful AI assistant in charge of generating weather reports. You will be prompted with
specific days and locations. You will generate a comprehensive weather report on the weather for 
that day and that location. Do not use your own knowledge at all, rely only on the tools you have 
been provided to collect information.
"""

class Agent:
    Agent(system_prompt : str, tool_list : list, model : str, api_key : str) 
    # constructor, accepts a base system prompt and a list of tool
    # please not that the system_prompt passed to the constructor is only a base prompt, and extra 
    # additions are possible. Also accepts a string with an OpenAI model name, and an api_key
    # to access the model with.

    prompt(problem_prompt : str, max_react_iterations : int) # use the ReAct framework to agentically
    # solve a problem. The problem prompt is given in the problem_prompt argument, and the max_react_iterations
    # tells the maximum number of times the agent can iterate through the ReAct cycle.
