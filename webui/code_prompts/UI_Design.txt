Problem: Create a web front-end in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. The web front-end will be used
as GUI for an agentic LLM-based essay reviewer.

Design:
Dark color palette, using the following color theme:
    /** Base colors */
    --clr-dark-a0: #000000;
    --clr-light-a0: #ffffff;

    /** Theme primary colors */
    --clr-primary-a0: #baf17b;
    --clr-primary-a10: #c3f38a;
    --clr-primary-a20: #cbf499;
    --clr-primary-a30: #d3f6a8;
    --clr-primary-a40: #dbf8b7;
    --clr-primary-a50: #e2f9c5;

    /** Theme surface colors */
    --clr-surface-a0: #121212;
    --clr-surface-a10: #282828;
    --clr-surface-a20: #3f3f3f;
    --clr-surface-a30: #575757;
    --clr-surface-a40: #717171;
    --clr-surface-a50: #8b8b8b;

    /** Theme tonal surface colors */
    --clr-surface-tonal-a0: #21251c;
    --clr-surface-tonal-a10: #363931;
    --clr-surface-tonal-a20: #4c4f47;
    --clr-surface-tonal-a30: #63665f;
    --clr-surface-tonal-a40: #7b7e77;
    --clr-surface-tonal-a50: #949691;

    /** Success colors */
    --clr-success-a0: #22946e;
    --clr-success-a10: #47d5a6;
    --clr-success-a20: #9ae8ce;

    /** Warning colors */
    --clr-warning-a0: #a87a2a;
    --clr-warning-a10: #d7ac61;
    --clr-warning-a20: #ecd7b2;

    /** Danger colors */
    --clr-danger-a0: #9c2121;
    --clr-danger-a10: #d94a4a;
    --clr-danger-a20: #eb9e9e;

    /** Info colors */
    --clr-info-a0: #21498a;
    --clr-info-a10: #4077d1;
    --clr-info-a20: #92b2e5;

    /** Examples */
    .bg-primary {
    color: var(--clr-primary-a50);
    background-color: var(--clr-surface-a0);
    }

Main panel to the left into which the user can either copy and paste an essay or upload a pdf, which
is then converted to plaintext and put into the text box. 

A stylish control bar is on the right, with a placeholder application title and logo on top. It is 
devided into panels, each of which is collapsible. 

In the control bar, one of the collapsible panels is for AI Usage Level, which is a slider that 
allows the user to indicate what level of Generative AI they are allowed to use on this assignment.
The levels are GenAI 0, GenAI 1, GenAI 2, GenAi 3, GenAI 4, GenAI 5, and GenAI 6. The slider has a 
nice gradient with little circles to indicate where each level is. It will snap to the nearest level
automatically (fractional levels are not allowed). It will show a brief description of the selected 
level below the slider, which will transition smoothly whenever a different level is selected. The 
slider will default to level 0. Details about each AI level can be found in the pdf.

When there is text uploaded in the main box, a control panel will also appear. Based on a list of tool names
requested from the server, include a checklist which allows the user to select which tools should 
be available to the agent. Make it stylish, and do not use checkboxes. Also in the control panel is
a small text box in which additional instructions can be given to the LLM agent.

Finally, underneath all of these controls is a "Run" button, which is not collapsible. Selecting 
this button puts all of the collected data together in a consistent json format, which will be 
sent back to the server to be run through the LLM. The server will eventually respond with a 
json response of the format:
    {
        "revised_text" : "the new text of the essay",
        "additional_downloadable_files": [
            {
                "name": "Documentation",
                "extension": "pdf",
                "data": // the actual bytes of the file
            }
        ],
        "transcript": "A multiline transcript of the LLM's entire thought process"
    }
Until this response is recieved, a very smooth and stylish loading animation will play next to the 
"Run" button. Nothing in the UI can be edited (i.e. settings or text) while the application is waiting
for a response from the server. Once the response is recieved, the transcript will be available underneath
a separate tab on the essay text panel. The tab navigation bar is at the top, and allows the user to 
select between all the currently open tabs. All tabs that are not the main essay tab may be closed 
with a button on the tab in the navigation bar. The revised text will be updated into the essay 
text box. All of the additional files which have been returned by the server will have a button 
populated right underneath the essay text panel. Clicking any of these buttons will download the 
corresponding file.

Note that everything in this UI which changes at any point in time will be smoothly animated with 
transitions.

Because the server has not yet been fully implemented, any portion that relies on the server will
instead call one of several fake server interaction functions, which will wait for a reasonable 
amount of time and return some static example data, which will allow the program to proceed as if there 
were a server connected. All of these connections will be located in the same js file such that 
they can easily be hooked up to real server connections in the future.

Keep CSS, HTML, and JS in separate files.
